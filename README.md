# RedNote Group HCI Project SP25'
## Larry Tran, Jake Tran, Brandon Tran, Kaylee Nguyen, Tu Pham

The goal for this project is to create a website for a local boba store. 
The shop does not have a website that displays their info such as the menu, and anything for online ordering.
We also wanted to add a custom tool to the website that other boba stores did not have such as the boba builder tool.

We used React + Vite + Typescript for the front end to build this project and used javascript for the back end scripts.

### Running Locally
```
git clone **git@github.com:larryt03/BobaBuilder.gi***

cd src
npm i
npm run dev
open http://localhost:5173/
