# RedNote Group HCI Project SP25'
## Larry Tran, Jake Tran, Brandon Tran, Kaylee Nguyen, Tu Pham

The goal for this project is to create a website for a local boba store. 
The shop does not have a website that displays their info such as the menu, and anything for online ordering.
We also wanted to add a custom tool to the website that other boba stores did not have such as the boba builder tool.

We used React + Vite + Typescript for the front end to build this project and used javascript for the back end scripts.

### Running Locally
```
git clone **git@github.com:larryt03/BobaBuilder.gi***

cd src
npm i
npm run dev
open http://localhost:5173/
```
### How to order
Once you have successfully loaded up the app, you can view the menu which has a wide variety of options, and then you can check out the boba builder drink.
Adding your base drink on the left side and then adding to the toppings on the right side.
Throughout all of this you will see the boba builder in the middle all in real time as well as your cart.
You can go to the cart and then checkout with your tip and payment information.


### Challenges and Features to add in the future
We had a lot of trouble making the boba builder as creating the functionality of the boba builder was very time consuming, such as layering the drink and toppings with each other.
The checkout page was hard as well since we had to keep track of the customers data, calculating correct prices, and the payment method.

Features we would like to add in the feature are more realistic drink images, drag and drop, and customer rewards.
